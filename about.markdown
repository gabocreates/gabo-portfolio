                Gabe Leary: Creator and consultant in Brooklyn, NY.
            </span>    <br><br>
            Born in the creative landscape of Marin County and now based in Brooklyn, New York, I've always been guided by the language of making. My hands have been my primary tools of expression since childhood, constantly building, shaping, and bringing ideas to life through ceramics, textiles, and woodworking.
            <br><br>
            My approach to creating was shaped early through my art-based education, which instilled in me a belief that creativity is not separate from learning but fundamental to how we understand the world. This foundation served me when I later funded my travels across India, Nepal, Southeast Asia, and Europe by selling my ceramic work during college—experiences that expanded my visual vocabulary and deepened my appreciation for craft traditions across cultures.
            <br><br>
            Today, I navigate two seemingly different worlds: creating art in my studio and working as a management consultant at the intersection of energy transition and healthcare delivery. I see these two professional pursuits (climate, healthcare delivery) as points along the same spectrum of service—one addressing our collective relationship with the planet, the other supporting those facing challenges on a personal level. This perspective of service informs everything I create. Whether I'm throwing clay on a wheel, constructing a garment, or carving wood, each piece emerges from a desire to contribute something meaningful that connects maker and user in an intimate dialogue. 
            <br><br>
            Beyond my studio and consulting work, you'll find me feeding my soul through movement—catching waves while surfing, finding rhythm in running, or seeking the balance on a rock face through climbing. These activities, like my art practice, are exercises in presence and possibility. My portfolio represents not just objects made, but a continuing conversation about how we might live more fully, attentively, and responsibly in the world we share.
